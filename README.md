# Drew's Python Scripts

#### Install supporting software ####
This project uses pipenv for dependency management. More info here https://docs.pipenv.org/

If you already have pip installed, installing pipenv is very easy just run ```pip install pipenv```

If you do not already have pip installed run ```sudo easy_install pip``` (didn't actually try this myself since I already had it).

#### Install dependencies ####
From the project root run ```pipenv install --dev```

#### Run the lunch script ####
From the project root run ```pipenv run python src/lunch.py ```
